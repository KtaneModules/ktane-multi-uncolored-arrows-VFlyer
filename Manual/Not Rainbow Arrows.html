                <h2>On the Subject of Not Rainbow Arrows</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">What do you mean, "Point at Inverted Stores' Calculations!?" It points to nonsense!</p>
				<p>This module has eight arrow buttons in a randomized rainbow color arrangement, and a display screen in the center showing a randomly colored number from -7812 to 7812 inclusive. The eight possible colors the module can show are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple/violet, white, and black.</p>
				<p><strong>If the expert is not prepared to do extreme levels of calculation, tell the defuser to discard this module immediately. Do not continue looking at this manual. Do not ask the defuser about it. Just. Throw it away. Burn the manual.</strong></p>
				<p>Examine the flashes for each stage and perform mathematical operations to the values given to submit in balanced quinary, or balanced base-5. Tilting the provided casing may assist with finding the flashes better. Each flash from the arrows will denote a function from a table on this manual that must be performed on the current value. There are 3 stages to go through with each stage after the first adding one more flash than the previous stage, and the first stage having 2 flashes before the center text changes color briefly. <strong>The module may start on a later stage</strong>, so be careful! Completing a stage WILL change the color of the text, which will require the expert to obtain a different sequence.</p>
				<p>Each stage will utilize an initial value alongside a value that you must submit at the end of the stage. In addition, the values each colored arrow are assigned a different power of a given base that the expert must determine.</p>

                <h2>Obtaining the Calculated Value</h2>
				<p>Each arrow flash denotes an equation for each stage which the expert will need to calculate. A standard flash (1 specific color flash) will require the expert to solve for the output value, typically labeled as F(x). This is done by substituting x with a<sub>n-1</sub>, b<sub>n-1</sub>, or c<sub>n-1</sub> and solving for F(x), after applying other variables. An inverted flash (all but that specific color flash) will require the expert to solve for the input value, or x. This is also done in a similar fashion to solving for F(x) but with substituting F(x) with a<sub>n-1</sub>, b<sub>n-1</sub>, or c<sub>n-1</sub> and solving for x. The equations from the table underneath shown <strong>will not</strong> all be in F(x) = m * x + b format. Some manipulation to the equation is required.</p>
				<p>If the calculated value after finding the given variable is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>greater than 7812, subtract 7813 to the value until it is 7812 or lower.</strong></li>
					<li><strong>smaller than -7812, add 7813 to the value until it is -7812 or higher.</strong></li>
				</ul>
				<p>For the initial values:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a<sub>0</sub> is the displayed value on the module.</li>
					<li>b<sub>0</sub> is the last 3 base-36 digits in the serial number, modulo 15625, minus 7812. See the manual from Unfair's Revenge for obtaining the base-36 value.</li>
					<li>c<sub>0</sub> is the first 3 base-36 digits in the serial number, modulo 15625, minus 7812. See the manual from Unfair's Revenge for obtaining the base-36 value.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Other Variable Identifications:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>D = Sum of base 36 digits in serial number</li>
					<li>n = Current step in the calculations, 1 being the first step</li>
					<li>p<sub>n</sub> = the value at the specified step of the sequence. ("p" can be a, b, or c when specified, if n is not substituted, it can refer to the specific step of the calculations)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>3</sub>, c<sub>4</sub> are stages 1, 2, and 3's values to submit respectively.</p>

				<h2>Submitting The Calculated Value</h2>
				<p>In order to determine the values each colored button has, the expert will need to go through a series of condition in order to figure out which base belongs to the given colored button. Start on the rule corresponding to the color of the text to obtain the color that refers to the given value. Then use the color assigned from the last assigned arrow as the new rule to obtain the next color. Repeat until all of the colors are used up. If the target arrow is already assigned a given base or the target arrow is white or black, take the next arrow based on distance from the target arrow. If multiples on an arrow are not assigned and are tied from distance from the target arrow, assign the one going clockwise from the target color if it's not black or white. I.E. If the colors around the module are white, green, orange, purple, black, red, yellow, blue; and the target color is black, the color that should be taken instead should be red, purple otherwise if red is assigned a value.</p>

Then go counter-clockwise X times where X is the number of assigned colors up to this point in the calculations. If there is NOT a module that contains the color name of the current arrow, that arrow is your target arrow. (NOTE: Violet will count for Purple if the current arrow is purple.) Otherwise, the target arrow is the one 2 arrows clockwise from the current arrow.</p>

Modulo the result by 360. The target arrow is the arrow whose rotation from north is the closest to that value in degrees. For clarity, the range for the arrow pointing North is 338&deg; to 22&deg;. The other arrows' ranges when calculated clockwise can be found by adding 45&deg; to that given ranges for that given arrow.</p>

							<p>Using the grid of numbers on the right, (0, 0) will be referred to as the top-left corner of this grid, in (column, row) format, (2, 2) being the dead center of the grid. Start at the center of the grid shown if the displayed value has one or fewer digits. Otherwise, start at the column of the first digit of the displayed value, modulo 5, and the row of the last digit of the displayed value, divided by 2, rounded down. Examine the direction the blue arrow is at and go 1 space in that direction. If you reach the edge of the grid, wrap around to the opposite side, while respecting your current direction. Note the previous value, and rotate the current direction 45 degrees clockwise. Go two spaces in the new direction and note the previous 2 values. Using the last 2 noted values, add them together and modulo the result by 5. With the remaining noted value, determine the distance to reach that result, after mod 5. Starting on the blue arrow and skipping over black and white arrows, count that many arrows counter-clockwise if the shortest distance is moving left and clockwise otherwise. The resulting arrow is your target arrow.</p>
